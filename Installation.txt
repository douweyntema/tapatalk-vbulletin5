Tapatalk Plugin for vBulletin 5.x Installation

-- First Time Installation --
1. Upload the 'mobiquo' folder to the root of your vBulletin 5 installation. Ensure the folder can be accessed from your browser or else the mod may fail to work as designed.
2. In the vBulletin 5 AdminCP, go to Projects & Hooks -> Manage Products. Towards the bottom, click the [Add/Import Product] option.
3. You can import the file from your server using the 'import the XML file from your server' option. Input this './mobiquo/product-tapatalk.xml', then click the Import button.
4. The plugin has been installed and now you can configure it. The settings are located at AdminCP -> Settings -> Options -> Tapatalk - General Settings.

-- Upgrading from Pre 1.0.0 Tapatalk Plugin --
If you were using a version of the vBulletin 5 Tapatalk Plugin that came before Version 1.0.0, you should uninstall the Tapatalk Product from the vBulletin 5 AdminCP and also delete the 'mobiquo' folder. You may then continue with the steps listed above.
